CharlieAI thinks: "With a pair of sevens, I have a reasonably strong hand that can potentially improve on the flop. Since Alice has just called the big blind, I can raise to put pressure on her and build the pot while also protecting my hand. I will raise to the minimum required bet, which is double the big blind."

CharlieAI thinks: "I have a strong hand (pocket sevens) and I want to put pressure on Alice, who has already shown aggression by raising. A bet of the maximum allowed puts me in a strong position to win the pot."

CharlieAI thinks: "The current action is to call Alice's 20, which is the minimum requirement. I don't have a strong hand with my current cards (8d 3c), but since it's a marginal situation and the pot is already relatively large, calling allows me to see the river without committing more chips."
