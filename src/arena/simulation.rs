/// # Description
///
/// This code is implementing a version of Texas Hold'em poker. It is a
/// simulation of the game that can be played with computer agents. The game
/// progresses through a number of rounds: Starting,
/// Preflop,
/// Flop,
/// Turn,
/// River, and
/// Showdown.
///
/// The simulation creates a deck of cards, shuffles it, and deals cards to the
/// players. The players then take turns making bets, raising or folding until
/// the round is complete. Then, the game moves to the next round, and the
/// process repeats. At the end of the game, the player with the best hand wins.
///
/// The simulation is designed to be used with agents that can make decisions
/// based on the game state. The `HoldemSimulation` struct keeps track of the
/// game state, the deck, and the actions taken in the game.
///
/// The `run` method can be used to run the entire game
///
/// # Behavior
///
/// - Any agent bet that is an over bet will silently turn into an all in. That
///   is to say if an agent has 100 in their stack and bet `100_000_000` that
///   will be accepted and will be equivilant to bet `100`
/// - Any bet that `GameState` rules as being impossible, those that turn into
///   [`rs-poker::arena::errors::GameStateError`] will instead be turned into
///   fold.
/// - It's expected that you have the same number of agents as you have chip
///   stacks in the game state. If players are not active, you can use the
///   `FoldingAgent` as a stand in and set the active bit to false.
