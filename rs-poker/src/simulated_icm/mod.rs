//! This module provides the ability to simulate a mutli table independent chip
//! tournament. It does this via simulation. Different heros and villans go to
//! all in show downs. Then the resulting placements are computed as each player
//! busts.
//!
//! This method does not require a recursive dive N! so it makes simulating
//! tournaments with many different people and different payments feasible.
//! However it comes with some downsides.
//!
//! - The results are not repeatable.
//! - Small SNG's would be faster to compute with full ICM rather than
//!   simulations
//!
//! However it does have some other nice properties
//!
//! - It's parrallelizable. This can be farmed out to many different cores to
//!   speed
//! this up. Since each tournament is indepent there's little coordination
//! oeverhead needed.
//! - We can change the players skill easily. Since ICM just looks at the
//!   percentage or outstanding chips
